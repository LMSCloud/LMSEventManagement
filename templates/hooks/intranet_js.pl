=head3 intranet_js

This subroutine allows the plugin to inject custom JavaScript into the staff intranet interface.

You can return a string of JavaScript wrapped in C<< <script> >> tags if necessary, or include external JavaScript files by constructing the appropriate HTML. This gives the plugin flexibility to include inline JavaScript or reference external JavaScript resources as needed.
