=head3 cronjob_nightly

This subroutine is a plugin hook that is triggered by a nightly cron job.

Plugins can implement this method to perform routine tasks such as data cleanup, 
synchronization, or other maintenance work that needs to be executed on a scheduled basis.

The actual logic can vary depending on the pluginâ€™s requirements, and this hook 
offers flexibility for handling nightly background operations.
