=head3 opac_online_payment_end

This subroutine triggers the end of the online payment process in the OPAC.

The method should result in displaying a page that indicates the success or failure 
of the payment. Based on the input parameters (such as payment amount and account lines), 
the subroutine processes the payment and prepares the appropriate message for the patron.

It is responsible for handling payment validation and finalizing the transaction, 
depending on how the payment process is structured within the plugin.
