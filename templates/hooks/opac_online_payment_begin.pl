=head3 opac_online_payment_begin

This subroutine triggers the beginning of the online payment process in the OPAC.

The method can either result in displaying a form to the patron that is submitted, or 
it can directly redirect the patron to a payment service such as PayPal, depending 
on the plugin’s configuration and requirements.

It is responsible for gathering account details, payment method information, and preparing 
the necessary data for the payment process. The subroutine should be adapted based on 
the payment service being used and how the plugin handles online payments.
