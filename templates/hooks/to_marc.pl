=head3 to_marc

The existence of a C<to_marc> subroutine means the plugin is capable of converting a file to MARC format for use with the "Stage MARC records for import" tool.

This method is designed to convert data from an arbitrary format into MARC records. In this example, it processes a text file where each line follows the format:

    First name:Middle initial:Last name:Year of birth:Title

The subroutine parses each line and converts it into a basic MARC record, but this can be customized to suit other data formats or MARC record structures.
